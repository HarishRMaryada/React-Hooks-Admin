              responsibility. In the event a Customer reaches out to our
              Customer Support Team and informs us that an item has not been
              received, then our Customer Support Team may require you to
              furnish the proof of delivery ("PoD") within 5 (five) days of such
              intimation. As agreed at the time of your registration on the

              within a reasonable time, we will be compelled to record the order
              as not having been fulfilled, and you will receive a notification
              on the Merchant Dashboard intimating you of such record. In such
              event, the Customer will be entitled to a refund of the amount
              paid by him/her for the relevant product. You hereby agree to
              cooperate with us in order to resolve, to the Customer’s
              satisfaction, all cases of items that may have been shipped but
              not received. 4. You agree to accept all products that are sold by
              you on the Website and shipped, that may not have been delivered

              entitled to a refund of the amount paid by him/her for the
              relevant product. 5. Repeated complaints from Customers with
              regard to the same product or type of product may result in
              discontinuation of the listing of that particular product or type
              of product on the Website, and disciplinary action against you
              including temporary or permanent suspension of your selling

              the Customer returning the relevant product to you (in
              consultation with your team). However, if the amount required to
              be refunded to the Customer is higher than as mentioned herein,

              Customers are provided with refunds for products purchased from
              you, we shall, at our sole discretion, be entitled to set off the

              same from you. 8. As per applicable laws, you will be solely
